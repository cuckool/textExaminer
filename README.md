Hi,
This repository contains an easy to use package to analyze and produce statistics about the frequency of the words/letters from 
different text source.

Version 0.1:
Text source available : .txt and webpages.

Next steps:
- Implement twitter feed as a text source.
- Enhance the webpage analysis to avoid all the artefacts from the HTML and CSS
- Add recursivity on webpage analysis (with a certain recursivity level)
- Add website scrapping, to scan a whole website and use it as a text source.
